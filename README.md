#### This is my first fully working NodeJs application. For the first time I used mongoDB and Express in such an app and it was miraculous experience. Learned quite a lot about how the web-apps should work. For example I learned about .env, .node-version and .gitignore files. Also used git for the first time straight from VSCode and that also is a game-changer. ####
